# cyberhawk_task
Submission for my source code for the cyberhawk php dev role associated task

Notes: my first goal was to produce the logic that would solve the problem statement, a simple iterative loop with conditions is what I believe to be the best solution. In the php part of my code I decided that the output should be HTML for ease of display, rather than doing any unnecessary string manipulation. For display purposes I decided to assign different colours to the different states, with escalating colours of warnings: I decided that i would assign 'lightning strikes' blue as this seems to be the least concerning of the states, orange for coating damage, and red for 'lightning strikes and coating damage.'

After this I then produced a HTML page that implements a simple page with a text field and a button that loads the output from the logic above. 

I was unable to upload this webapp to AWS due to my unfamiliarity using AWS as well as time constraints.
